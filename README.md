3. Set Up the MySQL Database

Open MySQL Workbench, connect to your MySQL server, then run:
CREATE DATABASE mood_dashboard;
USE mood_dashboard;
CREATE TABLE moods (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    current_mood VARCHAR(50),
    main_reason TEXT,
    mood_three_days_ago VARCHAR(50),
    mood_one_week_ago VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);


If you have a .sql file from a previous version, you can import it:
MySQL Workbench → Server → Data Import → Import from Self-Contained File

4. Install Dependencies
Inside the project folder, run:
npm install

This installs:
express
mysql2
body-parser
cors

5. Configure the Backend

Open server.js and make sure your MySQL credentials are correct:
const db = mysql.createConnection({
    host: "localhost",
    user: "root",
    password: "YOUR_PASSWORD",   // replace with your MySQL password
    database: "mood_dashboard"
});

6. Start the Server
node server.js
If everything is working, you will see:

Connected to MySQL database!
Server running on http://localhost:3000

7. Open the Application

You can now:

Troubleshooting

Then restart the server.
